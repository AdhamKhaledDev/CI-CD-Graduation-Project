# CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Introduction

Welcome to our CI/CD Pipeline Project! This project is the portfolio project for ALX graduation, showcasing our skills in DevOps practices and tools. Our team, consisting of Adham Khaled and Gerges Zechariah, has implemented a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker on a sample application.

## Project Overview

This DevOps project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. We've utilized a sample application previously developed by Gerges Zechariah as the basis for our pipeline setup.

### Key Components:
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Continuous Integration**: Jenkins
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: Two Digital Ocean servers

## Sample Application: Typing Speed Test Game

The sample application used in this project is a Typing Speed Test Game. Below is an overview of the original application:

### Features
- Multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard
- Immediate word check functionality
- Dynamic score display
- Adjustable timer based on difficulty

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)

## CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

Our CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the Typing Speed Test Game application. Here's a high-level overview of our pipeline:

1. **Code Repository**: GitHub hosts our application code and pipeline configuration.
2. **Continuous Integration**: Jenkins is set up to automatically trigger builds on code commits.
3. **Containerization**: Docker is used to create consistent, isolated environments for our application.
4. **Deployment**: The pipeline automatically deploys the containerized application to two Digital Ocean servers, ensuring redundancy and high availability.
